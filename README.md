# ReconstructingFacesfMRINN

- Go to the file "Neuroimaging Final Project.pdf" to view the final presentation that I helped complete with a group. My specific portion of the presentation entailed explaining the mathematics behind the machine learning method. It also entailed writing the details out more live on a chalkboard, so if you would like to know more, let me know, and I may add some more info about it later.
